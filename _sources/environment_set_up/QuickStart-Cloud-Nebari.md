# Cloud: Nebari Quick-Start
The HyTEST project is currently working on deploying an instance of [Nebari](https://www.nebari.dev/) JupyterHub. HyTEST will allow some of our priority users to test out this space once it is created. We will also provide instructions for how your project can deploy its own instance of Nebari JupyterHub. Nebari includes a shared space in the JupyterHub deployement, where all users can access and run each other's files/scripts. Any user can also quickly modify and update a set of shared kernels so that all users are working in the same development environment. This work is currently in development, and these instructions will be updated once this is available.

This document will help you set up the correct computing environment on a
USGS JupyterHub instance deployed on the Nebari. This instructional material
will be updated once the deployment has been created.
