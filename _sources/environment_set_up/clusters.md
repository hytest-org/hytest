# Starting a Dask Cluster

Many of the workflows in this repository are designed to take advantage of parallelism via dask clusters. The details of spinning up a cluster will differ, depending on the [compute platform](./README.md). We have boilerplate code to help in starting a suitable cluster for many of the computing environments where HyTEST workflows are likely to run.
