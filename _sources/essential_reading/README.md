# Essential Reading

This section holds reference documentation for foundational technologies used in HyTEST workflows.

Many tutorials and readings are available on the internet, some of which are collected [here](./ReadingsTutorials.md).

We have a particular reliance on **Dask** for parallel processing workflows. The common ways we use Dask parallelism are described [here](./Parallel_Dask.ipynb).

We describe some foundational methods for some of the ways that data is accessed in HyTEST workflows, such as through APIs, object storage (S3), and STAC catalogs in [Data Sources](./DataSources/README.md).
