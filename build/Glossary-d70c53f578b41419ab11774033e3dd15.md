# Glossary

A glossary of common terms used throughout Jupyter Book.

```{glossary}
**Chunk**
: Smaller, more manageable pieces of a larger dataset.

**Chunking**
: The process of breaking down large amounts of data into smaller, more manageable pieces.

**Chunk shape**
: The actual shape of a chunk, specifying the number of elements in each dimension.

**Chunk size**
: The size of the chunk in terms of memory, which depends on the chunk shape.

**Coordinate Reference System**
: A framework used to precisely measure locations on the surface of Earth as coordinates.

**Larger-than-memory**
: A dataset whose memory footprint is too large to fit into memory all at once.

**Partial Chunk**
: The final chunk along a dimensions of a dataset that is not completely full of data due to the chosen chunk shape not being an integer divisor of the dataset's dimensions.

**Rechunking**
: The process of changing the current chunk shape of a dataset to another chunk shape.

**Stored chunks**
: The chunks that are physically stored on disk.

**Virtual Zarr Store**
: A virtual representation of a Zarr store generated by mapping any number of real datasets in individual files (e.g., NetCDF/HDF5, GRIB2, TIFF) together into a single, sliceable dataset via an interface layer, which contains information about the original files (e.g., chunking, compression, etc.).
