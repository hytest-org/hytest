    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is chunking and why should you care?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of data '_chunks_' is closely aligned with the NetCDF and [zarr](https://zarr.dev/) standards for storing N-dimensional arrays of typed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chunks become more important as the size of the array increases.  For very large arrays, it is helpful to organize the memory it occupies  into sub-units.  These sub-units are the chunks -- note that this is not another dimension to the array, but merely a map to how the large array is partitioned into more palatable sized units for manipulation in memory. Array-handling libraries (numpy, xarray, pandas, and others) will handle all of the record-keeping to know which chunk holds a given unit of the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quick side-bar to illustrate two chunking patterns for a simple 2D array.  This is a simplified use-case.  Consider a square array of integer values. Just for exposition, let's use a small array 10x10. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "illustration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That array can be organized in memory in a few ways... two common options are **row-major** order, and **column-major** order:\n",
    "* Row-Major -- A row of data occupies a contiguous block of memory. This implies that cells which are logicall adjacent vertically are not physicall near one another in memory. The 'distance' from `r0c0` to `r0c1` (a one-cell logical move within the row) is short, while the 'distance' to `r1c0` (a one-cell logical move within the column) is long.\n",
    "* Column-Major -- A column of the array occupies a contiguious block of memory. This implies that cells which are adjacent horizontally are not near one another physically in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "In either chunk mapping, `r3c5` (for example) still fetches the same value -- the array still indexes/addresses in the same way -- but the chunking plan determines how nearby an 'adjacent' index is. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the size of the array increases, the chunk pattern becomes more relevant. Suppose your data is chunked by **rows**, and you need to process a **column** of data -- your process will need to read a lot of data, skipping most of it (possibly going to disk to read more data if the dataset is very large), to get the $i^{th}$ column value for each row. For this analysis, it would be better if the array could be '_re-chunked_' from row-major order to column-major order.  This would favor column operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Array size is important to the chunking plan... it could be that an entire row of data in a large 2D array won't fit into memory (or it can't fit into a contiguous block of memory).  This would require chunking each row of data, in addition to chunking rows over columns (for a row-major plan) As dimensions are added to the array, this chunk-mapping becomes more complex and it becomes much more relevant to chunk the data to match the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros &amp; Cons\n",
    "Data that is well-organized to optimize one kind of analysis may not suit another kind of analysis on the same data. Re-chunking is time-consuming, and it produces a separate copy of the dataset, increasing storage requirements. The initial time commitment is a one-time operation so that future analyses can run quickly. The space commitment can be substantial if a complex dataset needs to be organized for many different analyses.\n"
