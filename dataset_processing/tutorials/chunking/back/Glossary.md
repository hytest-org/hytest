A glossary of common terms used throughout Jupyter Book.

```{glossary}
**Chunk**
    Smaller, more manageable pieces of a larger dataset.

**Chunking**
    The process of breaking down large amounts of data into smaller, more manageable pieces.
    
**Chunk shape**
    The actual shape of a chunk, specifying the number of elements in each dimension.
    
**Chunk size**
    The size of the chunk in terms of memory, which depends on the chunk shape.

**Coordinate Reference System**
    A framework used to precisely measure locations on the surface of Earth as coordinates.
    
**Larger-than-memory**
    A dataset whose memory footprint is too large to fit into memory all at once.

**Partial Chunk**
    The final chunk along a dimensions of a dataset that is not completely full of data due to the chosen chunk shape not being an integer divisor of the dataset's dimensions.
    
**Rechunking**
    The process of changing the current chunk shape of a dataset to another chunk shape.
    
**Stored chunks**
    The chunks that are physically stored on disk.

**Virtual Zarr Store**
    A virtual representation of a Zarr store generated by mapping any number of real datasets in individual files (e.g., NetCDF/HDF5, GRIB2, TIFF) together into a single, sliceable dataset via an interface layer, which contains information about the original files (e.g., chunking, compression, etc.).
