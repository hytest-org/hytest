# Data Chunking Tutorial Overview

Chunking data is an important foundational step in preparing data for HyTEST workflows. It helps massive datasets be easily subsetted (without having to download the whole dataset), and it supports efficient parallelized workflows. Organizing and chunking the data appropriately will dramatically affect the performance of analyses.

In this tutorial, we will go over all levels of information on data chunking,
from the basic introductions on the topic to complex methods of selecting optimal chunk sizes and rechunking on the cloud.
Much of what is covered in this tutorial replicates concepts covered in a variety of materials that we cite as we go.
However, that material has been adapted to use data that looks like data you might encounter in a HyTEST workflow.

The content is split into two primary sections:

 - [Introduction to Chunking](./101/index.md)
 - [Advanced Topics in Chunking](./201/index.md)

In [Introduction to Chunking](./101/index.md), we discuss all of the basic introductory topics associated with chunking.
As for [Advanced Topics in Chunking](./201/index.md), we dive into some more advanced topics related to chunking,
which require a firm understanding of introductory topics.

Feel free to read this tutorial in order (which has been set up for those new to chunking) or jump directly to the topic that interests you:
