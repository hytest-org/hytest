    "If a workflow needs to access S3, it will be important to establish AWS credentials before first access to the object storage. If you are working in a workflow using a dask cluster, you will need to establish AWS credentials **before** the cluster starts up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block will handle*general configuration for establishing AWS credentials for the notebook and any spawned cluster workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to make sure your `AWS_PROFILE` or `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` environmental variables are established before this is run. If they are not, the defaults will be set to the access the OSN storage pod (with a profile named `osn-hytest-scratch` and an endpoint of `https://usgs.osn.mghpcc.org`), which will only work if you have this AWS profile configured. Please reach out to asnyder@usgs.gov if you are a USGS staff member and you would like access to the credentials for this scratch space to test out our tutorials."
