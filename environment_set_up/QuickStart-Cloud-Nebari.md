# Cloud: Nebari Quick-Start
The HyTEST project has successfully deployed an instance of [Nebari](https://www.nebari.dev/) JupyterHub in the USGS cloud account. Nebari includes both a private (per user) and shared file space in the JupyterHub environment. Any user can also quickly modify and update a set of shared kernels so that all members of a team can use the same development environment. HyTEST will allow some of our priority users to test their workflows in this space; please contact Amelia Snyder (asnyder@usgs.gov) if you would like to request access to this space. The HyTEST team is currently working on developing instructions for how your project can deploy its own instance of Nebari JupyterHub in the USGS cloud.

This document will soon be updated to help you set up your computing environment in the HyTEST deployment of Nebari.
