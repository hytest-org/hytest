# Essential Reading

This folder holds reference documentation for foundational technologies used in HyTEST workflows.

Many tutorials and readings are available on the internet, some of which are collected [here](./ReadingsTutorials.md)

We have a particular reliance on **Dask** for parallel processing workflows. The common ways we use Dask parallelism are described [here](./Parallel_Dask.ipynb)

We desribe some foundational methods for some of the ways that data is accessed in HyTEST workflows, such as through APIs, object storage (S3), and STAC catalogs in the [DataSources](./DataSources) folder.

We also have a document describing [how to prepare data for inclusion in the Geo Data Portal (GDP)](./gdp_data_prep.md). While we do not necessarily contribute our datasets to the GDP, this document is a good description of how to standardize data to a convention, and the context is useful for anyone creating and documenting datasets.
