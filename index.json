With a diverse community of developers, users, and stakeholders participating in the HyTEST Organization, there will be a pathway for sharing the best modeling tools and workflows into the future.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"FG2cHAo26g"}],"key":"CpFzrQ31Ai"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1},"end":{"line":6,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"About the HyTEST Repository","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1},"end":{"line":6,"column":1}},"key":"FUAwwiOA9w"}],"identifier":"about-the-hytest-repository","label":"About the HyTEST Repository","html_id":"about-the-hytest-repository","implicit":true,"key":"z2K2UxQ69D"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The HyTEST organization encompasses a multitude of repositories, however the ","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"rBdJIFTnw9"},{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/hytest-org/hytest","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"hytest repo","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"hMQXCQOyU1"}],"urlSource":"https://github.com/hytest-org/hytest","error":true,"key":"kFqUqkFZGr"},{"type":"text","value":" is where users can find demonstrations, tutorials, and explanatory Jupyter Notebooks for common workflows encountered in the hydrologic and atmospheric modeling fields.
